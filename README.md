During my training under the Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) division at the Airport Authority of India (AAI), Kolkata, I gained an in-depth understanding of how modern aviation systems ensure flight safety, efficiency, and reliability. The CNS division plays a crucial role in managing the exchange of real-time information between aircraft, ground stations, and other operational units. Through this training, I explored the technical infrastructure that supports air traffic management, flight monitoring, and navigation accuracy across Indian airspace.

The Communication module covered ground-to-air and ground-to-ground communication systems, including VHF, HF, and satellite-based links that facilitate continuous coordination between pilots and Air Traffic Control (ATC). I learned about the design and operation of various communication equipment used to maintain seamless contact with aircraft, ensuring safe and efficient routing during all phases of flight.

In the Navigation section, I studied the principles and practical implementation of navigational aids such as VOR (VHF Omnidirectional Range), DME (Distance Measuring Equipment), ILS (Instrument Landing System), and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System). This part of the training enhanced my understanding of how accurate navigation and positioning information supports aircraft guidance, particularly during approach and landing operations.

The Surveillance component focused on radar and non-radar surveillance systems like PSR (Primary Surveillance Radar), SSR (Secondary Surveillance Radar), and ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast). I observed how these technologies enable real-time aircraft tracking and contribute to maintaining safe separation between aircraft in congested airspace.

Overall, the training provided a strong practical foundation in the integration of CNS systems for flight safety and operational efficiency. It deepened my appreciation of how engineering, communication networks, and real-time data exchange work together to maintain the reliability of modern air traffic operations.
